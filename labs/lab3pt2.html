      Nesting is one of the important factors I have learned when creating a
      usable web page. Simple nesting mistakes can result in an unattractive web
      page. Regardless,it is illegal to have improper nesting in XHTML which is
      the more commonly used modern markup language. Nesting helps maintain
      proper order within your code.If nesting is improperly used, CSS may apply
      attributes to the wrong classes and id making nesting an important factor
      for developing usable web pages.

      The box model is another important factor to creating a usable web page.It
      is important for how html elements such as images are presented in the
      browser.It is responsible for the padding, border, and margin of content
      placed using html.Understanding the box model helps make CSS so much
      simpler when trying to place content in the right spots.

      Javascript is an object-based language that is important for making usable
      web pages too. The "objects" are items that have a defined existence.These
      objects include methods which are the actions that the object performs.
      This is where JavaScript becomes an important factor in creating a usable
      webpage. It is responsible for majority of the interactions made when
      visiting web pages.
