      This website has entirely too many advertisements that get in the way of
      the main purpose of the site.(point 7) This makes the site very
      inconvenient due to the lack of good website design.

      This site is one of the better sites to look at.Although it is a bit
      cluttered, It does a good job of using its search system to find exactly
      what you are looking for even if minor mistakes are made.(point 1)This
      makes the site very effective for people with disabilities or elderly
      people.

    <p>
      Back when I was in middle school,this website was terrible.However, it has
      made some improvements over the years. Particularly with improvements to
      the text fonts.(point 5)In the top right of the website it gives different
      text font sizes that people can read the website in to help with older and
      disabled users.One thing that I would change is making sure the color of
      links change on visited sites.(point 3)When on the "find schools"
      section,It is possible to click on school websites numerous times which
      can be very inconvenient.

    <h1>Critique 4</h1>
    <h4>ESPN</h4>
    <p>
      ESPN does a good job of just replacing new content on current pages.With
      as much information that you can get off of one page,there aren't a bunch
      of tabs being opened everytime you click on new information.(point 9)Also
      the sports articles that are on the website are very scannable.There are
      subheadings,different fonts,and even clickable links for further context
      of certain players and teams.(point 4)
