      <p> some of the main things I expect to learn from this course is how to use
      text editors to create html webpages.Also learning how to style these
      created webpages properly.</p>
      <a href="https://www.mdjonline.com/news/local/">Crtique 1</a>
      <p>This website has entirely too many advertisements that get in the way of the main purpose of the site.
      This makes the site very innefective and not a good website design.
      </p>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Critique 2</a>
      <p>This site is one of the better sites to look at.Although it is a bit cluttered, It does a good job of 
        using its search system to find exactly what you are looking for even if the spelling is off etc.
      </p>
      <a href="https://www.cobbk12.org">Critique 3</a>
      <p>this website doesn't have much font diversity. This makes the site almost have a fixed font size for everything. </p>
      <a href="https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/">Critique 4</a>
      <p>This website does a good job of advertizements while still not interfering with the overall efficiency of the site
        unlike in critique 1.
