      <p>This website has entirely too many advertisements that get in the way of the main purpose of the site.
      This makes the site very innefective and not a good website design.

      <p>This site is one of the better sites to look at.Although it is a bit cluttered, It does a good job of 
        using its search system to find exactly what you are looking for even if the spelling is off etc.
